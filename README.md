Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
It's Guanming, Second-Year student at UCL, studying Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. My journey has taken me from winning the Chinese National Python Competition (62nd place), to leading FIRST Robotics team 6433, and contributing to institutes like Tsinghua University's AI research and Princeton's PACT program. Now, I'm diving deep into robotics and AI at UCL.

I believe open-source is a programmerâ€™s romanticism â€” code as a shared tool for humanity.

Since 2022, my GitHub has evolved into a place for this idealism. I started with UC Berkeleyâ€™s CS285_22Fall_HW_Answers, then moved to open-sourcing my entire robotics journeyâ€”everything from Contrastive Learning to Transformer-based motion planning. My personal projects include:

BaristBot: Chrome extension for personalized LinkedIn outreach.
DeepFlow: A multimodal agent system for real-world decision-making.
JAX2GPT: Hands-on tutorials breaking down GPT architectures using JAX.
These tools reflect my goal: democratizing cutting-edge AI and making it accessible. Through tutorials reaching over 11K+ developers, I aim to turn academic complexity into practical, open-source fuel.

Now, Iâ€™m excited to explore the next chapter with LLMs, where I can blend architectural rigor and developer-centric tooling to create collaborative canvases for innovation.
